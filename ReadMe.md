# GitHub Experiment of Semantic Version Actions

This is just a simple repository that I'm using to test out various semantic versioning GitHub Actions to see which one I like best.

The [.github/workflows](.github/workflows/) directory contains the workflows I've tested.
Each workflow tests a single action, and is named after the action is uses for the test.
